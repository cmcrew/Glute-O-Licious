Glute-O-Licious was my final project for my Physical Computing and Introduction to Computational Media courses in Fall 2011 at NYU's ITP program. As this was my first semester programming, I recognize that my code could be much neater, more concise, and definitely more well-documented. In a sentence, Glute-O-Licious is a virtual-reality indoor cycling experience. As you ride the bike, you view a first-person video of a beautiful cycling route. The video speed adjusts to the speed at which you are pedaling, giving you real-time feedback on your efforts! When you finish a workout your workout results are automatically uploaded to the website where you can view your data and see how you stacked up to other riders. The projects was done with Processing, Arduino, and Sinatra. You can read about the project at http://bit.ly/glute-o-licious.
